I work as a Data Scientist at DHL Express. 

Apart from work, I love dabbling in TinyML i.e applying machine learning models to small devices with low power and memory requirements. This means that microcontrollers excite me and I love working in this applied AI field.I am currently running the [Scaledown](http://scaledown-team.github.io/) intiative. <br />
<br />
After work, you can usually find me at Women Who Code,helping to build a video analytics dashboard for online events. 
<br />
In the weekends, I cycle around this tiny island called Singapore and blog my journey [here](https://medium.com/@varchanaiyer139/cycling-adventures-in-singapore-912d1f809961).
