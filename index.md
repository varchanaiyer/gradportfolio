I work as a Data Product Manager at Women Who Code. Women Who Code is a global non-profit organisation helping to increase the representation of diverse women in technology careers. My job revolves around creating Data strategy, analysis, and security ecosystem. 

Apart from work, I love dabbling in TinyML i.e applying machine learning models to small devices with low power and memory requirements. This means that microcontrollers excite me and I love working in this applied AI field.I am currently running the [Scaledown](http://scaledown-team.github.io/) intiative. <br />
<br />
After work, I love travelling and on the weekends can usually find me cycling around this tiny island called Singapore and blog my journey [here](https://medium.com/@varchanaiyer139/cycling-adventures-in-singapore-912d1f809961) or follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/88097637)
