I work as an AI Engineer at Continental Automotive. 
My field of work in TinyML i.e applying machine learning models to small devices with low power and memory requirements. This means that microcontrollers excite me and I love working in this applied AI field. 
After work, you can usually find me voluntering at Women Who Code, where I co-lead the cloud and python track as a Leadership Fellow. Apart from that, I actively participate in TinyML and WIML events. 
In the weekends, I cycle around this tiny island called Singapore and blog my journey here.
